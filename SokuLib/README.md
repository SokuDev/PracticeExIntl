# SokuLib
Library compiling reverse engineered elements of Touhou 12.3: Hisoutensoku from multiple source

## Disclaimer
All the code here is wasn't written by me.
This is a compilation of code from swrs and from other source such as code Slen gave me.
This is just an attempt to make it easier and more intuitive to interface with the game.
The work I did is just reorganize files and move existing code inside them.
All the sources are listed in each file.

## Understanding the source
If the source is written on top of a file, it means that all the code present in the file is from the said source.
If the source is written above a declaration (function, enum, class, ...), the declaration is from said source.
If the source is provided neither on top of the file nor above the declaration, it means I forgot to specify it.
Sources are only shown in header files. It will only be mentioned in a code file if the function or class is not mentioned in the header file, in the source code.
If no source is given in a code file (.cpp), it doesn't mean I'm the one that made it !
